# 📡 Real-Time Motion Detection with Java WebSocket

This project is a real-time motion detection system using Java, WebSocket, and CSV logging. It acts as a WebSocket server that receives accelerometer-style data (`x`, `y`, `z`) and determines whether the device is **Moving 📱** or **Idle 📴**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📶 WebSocket server in Java (using `Java-WebSocket`)
- 🧠 Motion detection using standard deviation
- 📄 Logs all motion data to a CSV file (`motion_data_java.csv`)
- ✅ Detects whether device is **moving** or **idle**
- 🔗 Easy to connect with Python or mobile clients
